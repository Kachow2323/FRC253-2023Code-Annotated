# FRC253-2023Code-Annotated
Hello, These are my notes on the 2023 Bot. Take everything I comment lightly and with mistrust. This is based off what I know at the time I wrote it at, whether that be in the middle of comp, 3:00 AM like right, or some random time.
This years bot is fairly complex and honestly amazes me more as I continue to understand new things. I want to warn you **this isn't easy**! Take your time if you dont understand something. You will fail. You will cry. You will be angry. You will want to kill yourself but don't, the freshman need you.
