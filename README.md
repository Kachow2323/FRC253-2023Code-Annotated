# FRC253-2023Code-Annotated
Hello, These are my notes on the 2023 Bot. Take everything I comment lightly and with some jokes. This is based off what I know at the time I wrote it at, whether that be in the middle of comp, 3:00 AM like right, or some random time.
This years bot is fairly complex and honestly amazes me more as I continue to understand new things. I want to warn you **this isn't easy**! Take your time if you dont understand something. You will fail. You will cry. You will be angry. 

Content:
  - Comments on all subsystems, not yet complete.
  - Auto.java is pretty self-explanatory (its code --> english)

  - TBD: RobotContainer, Drive, Finish Subsys, more. 
//updated 2/4/24 - 5:18 PM - v1.2
